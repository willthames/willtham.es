A new year brings a new blog. I've been doing lots of cool things recently in
the world of tech, particularly with AWS and Ansible, and it's time to write 
some of my learnings down so that others can benefit. 

My [other blog](http://will.thames.id.au/) will remain dedicated to the world
of endurance sport. 

Apologies for appearance - it's a minimally tweaked [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
blog. I'm sure it'll improve over time.

And there's a blog post that's really just rehashing what was already at
http://willthames.github.io.
