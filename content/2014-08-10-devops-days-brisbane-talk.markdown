At [Devops Days Brisbane](http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-brisbane/) I gave a talk called
"Designing and Devoloping Software for Operations", providing my thoughts and advice to 
help write software that is easy to operate.

### Technical aside

I wrote the slides in markdown and 
[used pandoc to convert them](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html) 
to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) format. I found it much quicker than writing the
slides in HTML. Original source is on [Github](https://github.com/willthames/devopsdays2014)
