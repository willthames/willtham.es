One of the most common things to configure in an application is some kind
of credentials based connection. Typically this will be to a database or 
an API endpoint, but it doesn't really matter too much - the examples in
this post will be database configuration, but the principles are the same.
<!--more-->
I'll use the same example from the 
[previous blog post](/2014/03/17/ansible-layered-configuration-for-aws.html)
and also put the configuration into the same
[github repo](https://github.com/willthames/ansible-ec2-example).

For simplicity's sake, we'll assume we're trying to write a file called
config.properties that has database configuration in the form of a simple
jdbc type URL - e.g.

```ini
customerdb=jdbc:postgresql://db1.prod.example.com:3306/customers?user=webapp&password=changeme
storedb=jdbc:postgresql://db2.prod.example.com:3306/store?user=webapp&password=changeme2
```

In terms of things that remain the same between environments, the DB type, 
DB name and username are likely to be consistent, and password, DB servers, 
and possibly port will vary. It's very likely that DB type will be so 
consistent that we might hardcode it in the template rather than having
unnecessary templating (there can be a temptation to template everything
but the principle of <dfn title="YAGNI"><abbr title="You Ain't Gonna Need It">YAGNI</abbr></dfn> applies)

Between DBs in the same environment, there is little in common, but if more 
than one application uses the same DB then they might share configuration
(possibly with different usernames and passwords, depending on security
and monitoring requirements).

In terms of the location of credentials, we'll store everything in the flat
inventory files, with the exception of DB passwords which will be stored
in separate variable files (in a separate repo, or even using ansible vault)

<div class="clearfix">
<img src="images/webapp.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</div>

There are a number of ways to achieve this in Ansible.
<h2>Flat configuration strings</h2>
<h3>inventory/group_vars/all.yml</h3>

```yaml
customerdb_dbname: customers
storedb_dbname: store
```

<h3>inventory/group_vars/production.yml</h3>
```yaml
customerdb_host=db1.prod.example.com
customerdb_port=3306
storedb_host=db2.prod.example.com
storedb_port=3306
```

<h3>inventory/group_vars/web.yml</h3>
```yaml
customerdb_user=webapp
storedb_user=webapp
```

<h3>web/templates/config.properties.tmpl.v1</h3>
```yaml
customerdb=jdbc:postgresql://{{customerdb_host}}:{{customerdb_port}}/{{customerdb_dbname}}?user={{customerdb_user}}&password={{customerdb_password}}
storedb=jdbc:postgresql://{{storedb_host}}:{{customerdb_port}}/{{storedb_dbname}}?user={{storedb_user}}&password={{storedb_password}}
```

<h2>Hierarchical configuration</h2>
We can use hierarchical dictionaries of properties to configure properties
in a slightly nicer fashion - rather than have variables named customerdb_dbname
we can have a customerdb object that has a dbname property. And the
storedb will have similar properties.


{{<alert class="info">}}
Set <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/intro_configuration.html#hash-behaviour">hash_behaviour</a> to merge for this to work
{{</alert>}}

### inventory/group_vars/all.yml
```yaml
databases:
  customerdb:
    dbname: customers
  storedb:
    dbname: store
```

### inventory/group_vars/production.yml
```yaml
databases:
  customerdb:
    host: db1.prod.example.com
    port: 3306
  storedb:
    host: db2.prod.example.com
    port: 3306
```

### inventory/group_vars/web.yml
```yaml
databases:
  customerdb:
    user: webapp
  storedb:
    user: webapp
```

This version of the template is more sophisticated (and more complicated) but
allows both DB connection strings to be expressed in a for loop. 
The modelling of the credentials (see below under Secrets) allows us to 
map per-database usernames and passwords. 

### web/templates/config.properties.tmpl.v2
```yaml
{% for dbkey, db in databases.iteritems() %}
{{ dbkey }}=jdbc:postgresql://{{db.host}}:{{db.port}}/{{db.dbname}}?user={{db.user}}&password={{db.credentials[db.user]}}
{% endfor %}
```

Before we use this template, we'll discuss how we handle secrets.

## Secrets
There are a number of approaches to storing secrets. We'll show the old way 
by way of illustration so that we can run the playbook and generate the 
properties files. 

I've actually committed dbsecrets.yml to the ansible-ec2-example repo for
illustration, but it to keep sensitive information out of the playbooks
repository it would perhaps be in a separate, more locked-down repo.

### ../../secrets/dbsecrets.yml
```yaml
# v1
customerdb_password: changeme
storedb_password: changeme2

# v2
databases:
  storedb:
    credentials:
      webapp: changeme2
  customerdb:
    credentials:
      webapp: changeme
```

### web/playbooks/dbconfig.yml
```yaml
- hosts: web
  connection: local
  vars_files:
  - '../../privaterepo/secrets/dbsecrets.yml'

  tasks:
  - name: create v1 config.properties
    action: template src=../templates/config.properties.tmpl.v1 dest=/tmp/config.properties.v1

  - name: create v2 config.properties
    action: template src=../templates/config.properties.tmpl.v2 dest=/tmp/config.properties.v2
```

Running this then generates two almost identical configuration files 
(the order of the two DB configurations is not guaranteed - which 
shouldn't matter in general).

```yaml

[will@cheetah playbooks (db_config)]$ ansible-playbook -i ../../inventory/hosts  --limit prod-web-server-1a dbconfig.yml -vv

PLAY [web] ********************************************************************

```

## Ansible Vault
Ansible vault allows you to encrypt your secrets with a password. These 
encrypted files can then be safely part of the repo. 

The [Ansible vault documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_vault.html)
is excellent and so as per usual, this is purely for expository purposes.

I'll copy dbsecrets.yml to dbsupersecrets.yml and then encrypt it with
`ansible-vault encrypt dbsupersecrets.yml`

Should I then wish to edit the credentials, 
`ansible-vault edit dbsupersecrets.yml` 
will work.  I used the excellent password 'badpassword' should you 
wish to follow along.

Finally we can check this with a playbook that uses dbsupersecrets.yml and 
run `ansible-playbook` with `--ask-vault-pass`
```yaml

[will@cheetah playbooks (db_config)]$ ansible-playbook -i ../../inventory/hosts  --limit prod-web-server-1a dbvault.yml -vv --ask-vault-pass
Vault password: 

PLAY [web] ******************************************************************** 

GATHERING FACTS *************************************************************** 
<prod-web-server-1a> REMOTE_MODULE setup
ok: [prod-web-server-1a]

TASK: [create v1 config.properties] *******************************************

TASK: [create v2 config.properties] ******************************************* 
changed: [prod-web-server-1a] => {"changed": true, "dest": "/tmp/config.properties.v2", "gid": 20, "group": "staff", "md5sum": "65bdecffcdb33f6eb5ff3baf89ef8f1e", "mode": "0644", "owner": "will", "size": 185, "src": "/Users/will/.ansible/tmp/ansible-tmp-1396437646.66-279231900197780/source", "state": "file", "uid": 501}

PLAY RECAP ******************************************************************** 
prod-web-server-1a         : ok=3    changed=2    unreachable=0    failed=0  

```
And voil√†, config properties files with the much more secure 
password of 'Ch4ng3M3!'.

<h2>Addendum</h2>
03 April 2014

I realised my credentials modelling takes no account of environment. One simple way to do this is to store the environment name 
in the environment config file (i.e. add "env: production" to production.yml) and then have a hierarchy of vars files e.g.
../../secrets/production/dbsupersecret.yml

The nice thing about how Ansible Vault works is that you can choose to just encrypt the files under the production directory
and have cleartext versions for dev and UAT, and the same templates and playbooks will still work (you only need to then
pass --ask-vault-pass when running against production)

I've updated the github repo to reflect this, but the main change is to the location of the credentials files and the playbook:
```yaml

- hosts: web
  connection: local
  vars_files:
  - '../../secrets/{{env}}/dbsupersecrets.yml'

  ...

```
