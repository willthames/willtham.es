At [Devops Days Melbourne](http://devopsdays.org/events/2015-melbourne/) I gave
a companion talk to [last year's](/2014/08/10/devops-days-brisbane-talk.html) talk.
This year's is called "What Operations can learn from Developers" and talks about
how Ops can make use of the same practices and techniques that developers use
to maintain great code.

* [Slides](/devopsdays2015/) \[[pdf](/What Ops can learn from Dev.pdf)\]
* Video - to be added

### Technical aside

I wrote the slides in markdown and 
[used pandoc to convert them](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/demo/example9/producing-slide-shows-with-pandoc.html) 
to [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) format. I found it much quicker than writing the
slides in HTML. Original source is on [Github](https://github.com/willthames/devopsdays2015)
