Inspired by my recent efforts to handcraft Ansible inventory graphs, 
and wanting to be able to quickly see what groups are used for 
a particular host in Ansible inventory, I decided to generate some
graphs.

There is a useful discussion on [ansible-devel](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/ansible-devel/mEovLhqWTV0) and I know [@svg](http://twitter.com/svg) is doing more work on improving ansible inventory so hopefully things 
will yet get easier. 

My solution uses Ansible's inventory libraries where possible, and 
then generates a [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org) DOT file format
in quite an opinionated fashion (currently there is no way to 
choose fonts or shapes, the program chooses for you!)


The result is in my [ansible-inventory-grapher Github repo](https://www.github.com/willthames/ansible-inventory-grapher) and I have an example from
my [ansible-ec2-example](https://www.github.com/willthames/ansible-ec2-example)
inventory:
{% highlight text %}
$ bin/ansible-inventory-grapher
Usage: ansible-inventory-grapher [options] host1 [host2 ...]

Options:
  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
  -i INVENTORY     
  -d DIRECTORY     Location to output resulting files [current directory]
  --format=FORMAT  python format string to name output files
                   ["{hostname}.dot"]

$ bin/ansible-inventory-grapher -i ../ansible-ec2-example/inventory/hosts prod-web-server-78a prod-web-server-28a -d test --format "test-{hostname}.dot"
{% endhighlight %}
(The above assumes that you've downloaded both repositories under a common parent - I use ~/src/)

The resulting graphs can then be converted to pngs using:
{% highlight text %}
for f in test/*.dot ; do dot -Tpng -o test/`basename $f .dot`.png $f; done
{% endhighlight %}
(Again, the above assumes graphviz is installed - use your package manager
of choice for that - yum, apt-get, brew, chocolatey(?))

That then results in a reasonable looking inventory graph for e.g. 
prod-web-server-78a:
<div class="clearfix">
<img src="/images/prod-web-78a.png" class="img-thumbnail">
</div>

### Improvements
<ul><li>Better customisation of appearance (fonts, node styles etc)</li>
<li>Optionally include what variables come from which group</li>
<li>Offer other output formats than DOT format</li></ul>
